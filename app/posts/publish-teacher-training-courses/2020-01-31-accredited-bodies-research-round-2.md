Round 2 was a containuation of the resreach started in [Accredited Bodies Research Round 1](link) where we hoped to gain further insights into the needs of Accredited Bodies around reporting.

## Findings

### Student Information Systems

ABs have a student record information system that syncs automatically with UCAS.

### The Systems Sync with UCAS

There is an automatic sync that happens between their system and UCAS. Applications that come via UCAS get linked to their student record system.

### Changes aren't automatically synced

The participants needed to know about any new courses so that they can update the courses on their system

### Stuck in between UCAS and SITS

There is an area where candidates get ‘lost’ if courses on UCAS don’t align with the Accredited Bodies system.

### A need for notifications

The notification needs vary for different Accredited Bodies

### A need to see what’s been published

There is a need to see what courses have been created and published.

## Research Summary

* Need to know about courses for marketing materials and purposes as well as ensuring courses are set up correctly on their system 
* There is a student information system which pulls applications and pushes data from UCAS. This is an automatic process.
* Need to know of any changes to courses or new courses. Applications get stuck in staging area which is when the application from UCAS can’t match up with offerings in the Accredited Bodies SITS system.
* Need an alerts / notification design that tells Accredited Bodies of changes so that they know when things have changed so that systems can be updated as soon as possible to avoid candidate transit change issues.
* Need to know about courses with the location status. This is because courses are multi-faceted.
* Need to be able to compare allocations with Accredited Body reports to ensure courses are set up correctly.
