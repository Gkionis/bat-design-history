Round 2 was a containuation of the resreach started in [Accredited Bodies Research Round 2](link) where we hoped to gain further insights into the needs of Accredited Bodies around reporting.

## Findings

### Student Information Systems

ABs have a student record information system that syncs automatically with UCAS.

### The Systems Sync with UCAS

There is an automatic sync that happens between their system and UCAS. Applications that come via UCAS get linked to their student record system.

### Changes aren't automatically synced

The participants needed to know about any new courses so that they can update the courses on their system

### Stuck in between UCAS and SITS

There is an area where candidates get ‘lost’ if courses on UCAS don’t align with the Accredited Bodies system.
